abstract = {Big Data (BD) solutions are designed to better support decision-making processes in order to optimize organizational performance. These BD solutions use company’s core business data, using typically large datasets. However, data that doesn’t meet adequate quality levels will lead to BD solutions that will not produce useful results, and consequently may not be used to make adequate business decisions. For a long time, companies have collected and stored large amounts of data without being able to exploit the advantage of exploring it. Nowadays, and thanks to the Big Data explosion, organizations have begun to recognize the need for estimating the value of their data and, vice-versa, managing data accordingly to their value. This need of managing the Value of data has led to the concept of Smart Data. It not only involves the datasets, but also the set of technologies, tools, processes and methodologies that enable all the Values from the data to the End-users (Business, data scientist, BI…). Consequently, Smart data is data actionable. We discovered that data quality is one of the most important issues when it comes to “smartizing” data. In this paper, we introduce a methodology to make data smarter, taking as a reference point, the quality level of the data itself.},

abstract = {In healthcare sector huge quantities of data about patients and their medical conditions have been gathered through clinical databases and various other healthcare processes. Currently, it records nearly all aspects of care, including patient personal information, clinical trials, hospital records, diagnosis, medication, test results, imaging data, costs, administrative reports, etc. Like in other application domains, the big data revolution holds also great promise in the area of healthcare, as the available data about individual patients is very rich, and hides crucial knowledge that can be exploited to improve patients' care while reducing its cost. For instance, in 2012 worldwide collected healthcare data was estimated to be in the region of 500 petabytes and it is expected to grow 50 times more in 2020 (25 Exabytes). Turning this massive amount of data into knowledge that can be used to identify needs, predict and prevent critical patients' conditions, and help practitioners to make rapid and accurate decisions is not only a desire but is of urgent and crucial necessity. Therefore, healthcare organisations must have the ability to manage and analyse their data in a rapid and efficient manner to answer several critical questions related to diseases, treatments, patients' behaviours, and care management. However, building such system faces huge challenges: 1) data complexity, 2) Privacy, security, ethical, legal, and social issues, and 3) Interoperability, portability, and compatibility. We will discuss all these challenges and the requirements of healthcare ecosystem. This will lead us to describe some innovative methodologies of how to build such ecosystem to face the healthcare challenges of the next decade or so.},
