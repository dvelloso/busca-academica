abstract = {Beyond the hype of Big Data, something within business intelligence projects is indeed changing. This is mainly because Big Data is not only about data, but also about a complete conceptual and technological stack including raw and processed data, storage, ways of managing data, processing and analytics. A challenge that becomes even trickier is the management of the quality of the data in Big Data environments. More than ever before the need for assessing the Quality-in-Use gains importance since the real contribution–business value–of data can be only estimated in its context of use. Although there exists different Data Quality models for assessing the quality of regular data, none of them has been adapted to Big Data. To fill this gap, we propose the “3As Data Quality-in-Use model”, which is composed of three Data Quality characteristics for assessing the levels of Data Quality-in-Use in Big Data projects: Contextual Adequacy, Operational Adequacy and Temporal Adequacy. The model can be integrated into any sort of Big Data project, as it is independent of any pre-conditions or technologies. The paper shows the way to use the model with a working example. The model accomplishes every challenge related to Data Quality program aimed for Big Data. The main conclusion is that the model can be used as an appropriate way to obtain the Quality-in-Use levels of the input data of the Big Data analysis, and those levels can be understood as indicators of trustworthiness and soundness of the results of the Big Data analysis.}

abstract = {The recent explosive publications of big data studies have well documented the rise of big data and its ongoing prevalence. Different types of “big data” have emerged and have greatly enriched spatial information sciences and related fields in terms of breadth and granularity. Studies that were difficult to conduct in the past time due to data availability can now be carried out. However, big data brings lots of “big errors” in data quality and data usage, which cannot be used as a substitute for sound research design and solid theories. We indicated and summarized the problems faced by current big data studies with regard to data collection, processing and analysis: inauthentic data collection, information incompleteness and noise of big data, unrepresentativeness, consistency and reliability, and ethical issues. Cases of empirical studies are provided as evidences for each problem. We propose that big data research should closely follow good scientific practice to provide reliable and scientific “stories”, as well as explore and develop techniques and methods to mitigate or rectify those ‘big-errors’ brought by big data.}

abstract = {Background
Activating prior medical knowledge in diagnosis and treatment is an important basis for clinicians to improve their care ability. However, it has not been systematically explained whether and how various big data resources affect the activation of prior knowledge in the big data environment faced by clinicians.
Objective
The aim of this study is to contribute to a better understanding on how the activation of prior knowledge of clinicians is affected by a wide range of shared and private big data resources, to reveal the impact of big data resources on clinical competence and professional development of clinicians.
Method
Through the comprehensive analysis of extant research results, big data resources are classified as big data itself, big data technology and big data services at the public and institutional levels. A survey was conducted on clinicians and IT personnel in Chinese hospitals. A total of 616 surveys are completed, involving 308 medical institutions. Each medical institution includes a clinician and an IT personnel. SmartPLS version 2.0 software package was used to test the direct impact of big data resources on the activation of prior knowledge. We further analyze their indirect impact of those big data resources without direct impact.
Results
(1) Big data quality environment at the institutional level and the big data sharing environment at the public level directly affect activation of prior medical knowledge; (2) Big data service environment at the institutional level directly affects activation of prior medical knowledge; (3) Big data deployment environment at the institutional level and big data service environment at the public level have no direct impact on activation of prior knowledge of clinicians, but they have an indirect impact through big data quality environment and service environment at the institutional level and the big data sharing environment at the public level.
Conclusions
Big data technology, big data itself and big data service at the public level and institutional level interact and influence each other to activate prior medical knowledge. This study highlights the implications of big data resources on improvement of clinicians’ diagnosis and treatment ability.}
