Geographers are benefitting from varied data types including administrative data, social media, volunteered geographic information, and consumer data. The article presents examples and illustrations associated with each of these data types. An additional benefit of Big Data analytics is that it brings geographers into closer contact with real world partners and policy problems. Big Data also attract challenges including representational bias, variable data quality, difficulties of access and ownership, and ethical and legal restrictions in their use. Hence we conclude that Big Data are ripe for fruitful exploitation, but careful investments will be necessary if opportunities are to be realized to the full.",https://doi.org/10.1016/B978-0-08-102295-5.10616-X,2020,Mark Birkin,incollection
